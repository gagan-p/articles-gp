## Executive Summary

This analysis examines bilateral trade flows between the United States, India, and Iran during 2022-2023, focusing on the impact of long-standing US sanctions on Iran and India's trade policy responses. Unlike the Russia case (where sanctions created pricing adjustments), the Iran case demonstrates **near-complete trade severance** in critical sectors (crude oil) combined with persistent but declining non-oil trade.

**Key Observable Findings:**

- India's crude oil imports from Iran: **$2.8B (2019) → $0 (2020-2023)** following US sanctions
- India-Iran total bilateral trade: **$2.5B (2022) → $1.8B (2023)**, a **26% decline**
- US-India bilateral goods trade: **$133.0B (2022) → $128.6B (2023)**, demonstrating **resilience despite Iranian trade severance**
- India's trade balance **improved** in 2023 (CAD: 2.0% → 0.7% of GDP) despite loss of discounted Iranian oil

**Research Question:** Do tariffs and sanctions materially reduce trade value, or are their effects economically neutralized through price discounts, trade redirection, and third-country substitution?

**Answer (Iran Case)**: Unlike the Russia case, US sanctions on Iran achieved **substantial trade volume reduction** for crude oil (100% decline since 2019), though non-oil trade persists through informal channels and compliant categories.

## Data Sources and Methodology

### Primary Data Sources

All data used in this analysis come from official and authoritative sources:

| Source | Data Type | Time Period | Access Date |
|--------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| UN Comtrade | Bilateral trade flows | 2019-2023 | January 2026 |
| India Ministry of Commerce | India-Iran trade | 2019-2024 | January 2026 |
| US Census Bureau | US-India trade | 2019-2023 | January 2026 |
| India Embassy Tehran | Bilateral trade data | FY 2022-23 | January 2026 |
| World Bank | Trade balance, CAD | 2019-2023 | January 2026 |
| Iran International | Trade statistics | 2022-2023 | January 2026 |

### Methodological Approach

1. **Baseline-Comparison Method**: Establish 2019 pre-sanctions baseline, compare to 2022-2023 outcomes
2. **Trade Decomposition**: Separate oil vs. non-oil trade to isolate sanctions effectiveness
3. **Substitution Analysis**: Examine whether Iranian oil imports were replaced by alternative sources
4. **Compliance Assessment**: Evaluate India's adherence to US sanctions despite economic costs

### Known Limitations

- **Informal Trade**: Official statistics may undercount informal trade channels and hawala settlements
- **Attribution**: Cannot fully separate sanctions effects from Iran's domestic economic constraints
- **Third-Party Routing**: Limited visibility into potential Iranian goods re-routed through UAE, Turkey, or other intermediaries
- **Quality**: Non-oil trade categories may involve sanctioned vs. compliant goods mixtures
- **Time Lag**: Banking restrictions may delay reported transactions, creating data artifacts

---

## Hypothesis Testing Framework

We test the same five hypotheses as in the US-India-Russia case, but expect **different outcomes** given the structure of US-Iran sanctions:

### H1: Tariff Absorption Hypothesis
**Expected**: Similar to Russia case - Indian exporters absorb US tariffs on exports to US market.

### H2: Input Discount Offset Hypothesis  
**Expected**: **NOT APPLICABLE** - India ceased Iranian oil imports in 2019, so no discount offset mechanism in 2022-2023.

### H3: Trade Redirection Hypothesis
**Expected**: India should substitute Iranian oil with alternative suppliers (Russia, Middle East) after 2019.

### H4: Sanction Leakage Hypothesis
**Expected**: **REJECTED** for crude oil - US secondary sanctions successfully severed India-Iran oil trade. Possible persistence in non-oil categories.

### H5: Short-Run Balance Neutrality Hypothesis
**Expected**: Similar to Russia case - India's external accounts remain stable despite loss of Iranian oil.

**Interpretation**: The visualization reveals **stark divergence** between US-India and India-Iran trade patterns:

1. **US-India Growth**: Despite geopolitical tensions, US-India trade expanded robustly (2019: $94.4B → 2023: $128.6B total)

2. **India-Iran Collapse**: India's imports from Iran fell **96%** from 2019 baseline ($10.8B → $0.67B in 2023), driven entirely by crude oil cessation

3. **Asymmetric Impact**: Indian exports to Iran declined only **29%** (2019: $2.4B → 2023: $1.7B), suggesting sanctions targeted Iranian exports more than imports

4. **Compliance Signal**: India's trade behavior demonstrates **high compliance** with US secondary sanctions, contrasting sharply with Russia case

    })
  ]
})
```

**Interpretation**: The data demonstrate **complete and immediate compliance** with US secondary sanctions:

- **Pre-sanctions (2017-2018)**: India imported ~0.5 million barrels/day of Iranian crude
- **Transition (2019)**: Volume declined to 0.17 mbd as waivers expired
- **Post-sanctions (2020-2023)**: **Zero reported crude oil imports**

This stands in sharp contrast to the Russia case, where India **increased** oil imports by 10x post-sanctions. The difference reflects:

1. **Sanctions architecture**: US secondary sanctions threaten financial system access for Iranian oil buyers
2. **Strategic calculus**: India prioritized US relationship over Iranian oil access
3. **Alternative availability**: Russia and Middle East suppliers could absorb demand

    })
  ]
})
```

**Interpretation**: India successfully **substituted Iranian oil** with alternative sources:

- **Russia**: Increased from 2% (2019) to **33% (2023)** - absorbed Iranian volume and more
- **Middle East**: Decreased from 63% to 45% - structural reallocation, not absolute decline
- **USA**: Increased from 4% to 7% - strategic diversification
- **Iran**: **0%** (complete cessation)

**Key Insight**: The substitution pattern reveals India's **strategic pivot** - Iranian oil was replaced primarily by discounted Russian oil (post-Ukraine invasion), with some US LNG/crude supplementation. This created a **coincidental offset** where one sanctions regime (Iran) was neutralized by another (Russia).

## Hypothesis Testing: Quantitative Results

### H1: Tariff Absorption Hypothesis - **SUPPORTED (Consistent with Russia Case)**

```{ojs}
//| label: tariff-analysis

// Weighted average US tariff rate (same as Russia article)
weightedAvgTariff = 4.76

// Calculate tariff burden on Indian exports to US
tariffBurden = {
  return {
    burden2022: (86.5 * weightedAvgTariff / 100).toFixed(2),
    burden2023: (85.7 * weightedAvgTariff / 100).toFixed(2)
  }
}

// Volume analysis: YoY growth rates
volumeGrowth = {
  return {
    exports2019to2022: ((86.5 - 58.6) / 58.6 * 100).toFixed(1),
    exports2022to2023: ((85.7 - 86.5) / 86.5 * 100).toFixed(1)
  }
}
```

**Findings:**

- **Weighted average US tariff on Indian goods**: `${weightedAvgTariff.toFixed(2)}%`
- **Implied tariff burden (2022)**: `$${tariffBurden.burden2022}B`
- **Implied tariff burden (2023)**: `$${tariffBurden.burden2023}B`
- **Export growth (2019→2022)**: `+${volumeGrowth.exports2019to2022}%`
- **Export growth (2022→2023)**: `${volumeGrowth.exports2022to2023}%`

**Assessment**: **Identical to Russia case** - Indian exports to US grew robustly (47.6% from 2019-2022) and remained stable in 2023, indicating successful tariff absorption or pass-through. The Iran sanctions did not alter India's US export performance.

---

### H2: Input Discount Offset Hypothesis - **NOT APPLICABLE**

```{ojs}
//| label: offset-calculation

// Iranian oil savings calculation (negative - India lost access)
iranianOilLoss = {
  const baselineValue2019 = 2.8; // USD billions
  const avgVolume2017_2018 = 0.5; // mbd
  const hypotheticalDiscount = 5; // Conservative estimate if sanctions didn't exist
  
  const lostVolume2020_2023 = avgVolume2017_2018 * 365 * 4; // 4 years
  const lostValue = lostVolume2020_2023 * 70; // Assume $70/barrel average
  
  return {
    annualLostVolume: avgVolume2017_2018,
    fourYearLostValue: (lostValue / 1000).toFixed(1),
    noDiscountAvailable: true,
    substituteSource: "Russia (with discounts starting 2022)"
  }
}
```

**Findings:**

- **Iranian oil imports (2022-2023)**: **$0B** (complete cessation)
- **Lost potential volume**: `${iranianOilLoss.annualLostVolume} million barrels/day`
- **Foregone imports (2020-2023)**: Approximately `$${iranianOilLoss.fourYearLostValue}B`

**Assessment**: Unlike the Russia case, there was **no Iranian oil discount** available to India during 2022-2023 due to complete trade cessation. However, India obtained substantial Russian oil discounts during the same period, which **indirectly compensated** for the loss of Iranian supply.

**Critical distinction**: The offset mechanism here operates through **source substitution** (Russian discounts replacing Iranian supply) rather than concurrent access to both discounted sources.

---

### H3: Trade Redirection Hypothesis - **STRONGLY SUPPORTED**

```{ojs}
//| label: redirection-analysis

redirectionMetrics = {
  // Iranian oil → Russia substitution
  const iranLoss2019to2023 = 2.8 - 0.0; // Oil component
  const russiaGain2019to2022 = 28.5 - 2.8; // Russia oil imports (from Article 1 data)
  
  // Total trade changes
  const iranTotalChange = (1.8 - 13.2); // Total bilateral 2023 vs 2019
  const russiaCompensation = 61.4; // Russia exports to India in 2023
  
  return {
    iranOilLost: iranLoss2019to2023.toFixed(1),
    russiaOilGained: russiaGain2019to2022.toFixed(1),
    substitutionRatio: (russiaGain2019to2022 / iranLoss2019to2023).toFixed(1),
    iranTotalDecline: Math.abs(iranTotalChange).toFixed(1)
  }
}
```

**Findings:**

- **Iranian oil lost (2019→2023)**: `$${redirectionMetrics.iranOilLost}B`
- **Russian oil gained (2019→2022)**: `$${redirectionMetrics.russiaOilGained}B`
- **Substitution ratio**: `${redirectionMetrics.substitutionRatio}x` (Russia replaced Iranian volume 9x over)
- **Total India-Iran trade decline**: `$${redirectionMetrics.iranTotalDecline}B`

**Assessment**: The hypothesis is **strongly supported** - India successfully redirected oil imports from Iran to Russia, with Russian imports exceeding the lost Iranian volume by a factor of 9x. This reflects both:

1. **Direct substitution**: Russian oil replaced Iranian crude
2. **Volume expansion**: India increased total imports from Russia beyond Iranian replacement

**Important note**: This substitution was **enabled by Russia's Ukraine invasion sanctions**, creating a fortuitous market opportunity for India.

---

### H4: Sanction Leakage Hypothesis - **REJECTED (for crude oil), PARTIAL (for non-oil)**

```{ojs}
//| label: sanction-effectiveness

sanctionImpact = {
  // Oil trade effectiveness
  const oilSanctionEffectiveness = (0.0 / 2.8 - 1) * -100; // 100% reduction
  
  // Non-oil trade persistence
  const nonOilBaseline2019 = 10.8 - 2.8; // Estimated non-oil component
  const nonOilCurrent2023 = 0.67; // Current imports
  const nonOilLeakage = (nonOilCurrent2023 / nonOilBaseline2019 * 100);
  
  return {
    oilEffectiveness: oilSanctionEffectiveness.toFixed(0),
    nonOilPersistence: nonOilLeakage.toFixed(1),
    overallAssessment: "Sanctions highly effective for strategic goods (oil), moderate leakage in non-strategic categories"
  }
}
```

**Findings:**

- **Oil sanctions effectiveness**: `${sanctionImpact.oilEffectiveness}%` (complete cessation)
- **Non-oil trade persistence**: `${sanctionImpact.nonOilPersistence}%` of baseline
- **Overall assessment**: ${sanctionImpact.overallAssessment}

**Assessment**: The Iran case demonstrates **bifurcated sanctions effectiveness**:

1. **Strategic goods (crude oil)**: Sanctions achieved **complete compliance** - zero reported imports since 2020
2. **Non-strategic goods**: Persistent trade in compliant categories (food, pharmaceuticals, chemicals)
3. **Unofficial channels**: Unknown extent of informal trade via UAE, Turkey, or hawala systems

**Contrast with Russia**: Whereas Russian sanctions achieved pricing effects but limited volume reductions, Iranian sanctions achieved **volume elimination** for targeted sectors. This reflects:

- Stronger secondary sanctions architecture (banking system exclusion)
- India's strategic prioritization of US relationship
- Availability of substitute suppliers

### H5: Short-Run Balance Neutrality Hypothesis - **SUPPORTED**

```{ojs}
//| label: balance-analysis

balanceMetrics = {
  const cadChange2019to2022 = tradeBalanceData[1].cadToGDP - tradeBalanceData[0].cadToGDP;
  const cadChange2022to2023 = tradeBalanceData[2].cadToGDP - tradeBalanceData[1].cadToGDP;
  
  return {
    cad2019: tradeBalanceData[0].cadToGDP.toFixed(1),
    cad2022: tradeBalanceData[1].cadToGDP.toFixed(1),
    cad2023: tradeBalanceData[2].cadToGDP.toFixed(1),
    deterioration2019to2022: cadChange2019to2022.toFixed(1),
    improvement2022to2023: cadChange2022to2023.toFixed(1),
    netChange2019to2023: (tradeBalanceData[2].cadToGDP - tradeBalanceData[0].cadToGDP).toFixed(1)
  }
}
```

**Findings:**

- **Current Account Deficit (% GDP)**:
  - 2019: `${balanceMetrics.cad2019}%`
  - 2022: `${balanceMetrics.cad2022}%`
  - 2023: `${balanceMetrics.cad2023}%`
- **Change (2019→2023)**: `${balanceMetrics.netChange2019to2023}` percentage points

**Assessment**: Despite losing access to Iranian oil and substituting with more expensive alternatives, India's external balance **improved** in 2023 relative to both 2019 and 2022. This demonstrates:

1. **Successful substitution**: Alternative oil sources (Russia) were secured at competitive prices
2. **Service exports**: IT and business services likely offset energy import costs
3. **Policy management**: India's central bank and fiscal authorities managed external stability effectively

**Critical insight**: The loss of Iranian oil did **not** create a balance of payments crisis, validating the short-run neutrality hypothesis even under complete trade severance.

```

**Key Takeaway**: The comparative analysis reveals that **sanctions architecture and third-party compliance** determine outcomes more than economic fundamentals:

- **Iran sanctions** succeeded due to comprehensive secondary sanctions and India's strategic choice to comply
- **Russia sanctions** failed to reduce volumes due to India/China non-compliance and weaker enforcement mechanisms

---

## Where Do Economic Costs Settle? (Iran Case)

### Observable Outcomes

1. **Complete Trade Severance (Oil)**: Unlike Russia, US sanctions on Iran achieved their stated objective - India ceased all crude oil imports from Iran

2. **Strategic Compliance**: India prioritized its US relationship over Iranian energy access, demonstrating **revealed preference** for Western alignment

3. **Successful Substitution**: Lost Iranian oil was replaced by Russian and Middle Eastern supplies, with **no net external balance deterioration**

4. **Persistent Non-Oil Trade**: India maintained ~$2B in compliant bilateral trade (food, pharmaceuticals), indicating **selective sanctions enforcement**

5. **Fortuitous Timing**: Russia's Ukraine invasion (2022) created discounted oil access that **indirectly replaced** lost Iranian supply

### Cost Allocation

| Economic Agent | Cost Borne | Evidence |
|----------------|------------|----------|
| Iranian Government | **Primary burden** - lost $10-12B annual oil revenue from India | Trade data |
| Indian Refiners | **Moderate burden** - higher procurement costs (2019-2021) before Russian alternative | Not directly measured |
| US Consumers | **No measurable impact** - Iran sanctions did not disrupt US-India trade | Trade resilience |
| Indian Trade Balance | **No burden** - CAD improved 2019→2023 | World Bank data |

**Critical Finding**: The economic costs of Iran sanctions fell **entirely on Iran**, with India successfully substituting supply sources and maintaining external balance. This contrasts sharply with Russia, where costs were shared through pricing adjustments.

---

## Synthesis: Sanctions Effectiveness Determinants

Based on the Iran case, effective sanctions require:

### 1. **Comprehensive Secondary Sanctions**
- **Iran**: SWIFT exclusion + banking restrictions + insurance prohibitions = high compliance costs for third parties
- **Russia**: Selective SWIFT exclusion + price cap (easily circumvented) = low compliance costs

### 2. **Target Country's Strategic Value**
- **Iran**: India prioritized US relationship > Iranian oil access
- **Russia**: India exploited arbitrage opportunity despite US pressure

### 3. **Alternative Supply Availability**
- **Iran**: Middle East + Russia could absorb Indian demand
- **Russia**: No alternative supplier with equivalent pricing for European/Indian buyers

### 4. **Sanctions Coalition Size**
- **Iran**: US + EU + major banks = comprehensive enforcement
- **Russia**: US + EU, but India/China/Turkey remain outside = sanctions leakage

### 5. **Time Horizon**
- **Iran**: Sustained pressure (2018-present) wore down third-party resistance
- **Russia**: Rapid sanctions triggered emergency arbitrage rather than compliance

## Falsification Paths

This analysis could be disproven or refined by:

1. **Evidence of unofficial Iranian oil flows** through third-country re-flagging or relabeling schemes
2. **Banking data** showing continued Iranian transaction settlements via alternative payment systems
3. **Firm-level data** from Indian refiners revealing quality-adjusted price comparisons between Iranian and substitute suppliers
4. **Longer time horizons** showing India's eventual return to Iranian oil if US sanctions weaken
5. **Product-level trade data** revealing sanctioned Iranian goods entering India through UAE/Turkey intermediaries

---

## Limitations and Caveats

1. **Unofficial Trade**: Official statistics likely undercount informal channels and re-routed goods
2. **Quality Adjustments**: Cannot assess whether substitute oil grades required refinery modifications or yield losses
3. **Banking Restrictions**: Payment mechanisms and settlement delays not visible in trade data
4. **Attribution**: Cannot fully separate US sanctions pressure from India's independent strategic choices
5. **Counterfactual**: Unknown what India-Iran trade would have been absent sanctions (may have declined regardless)
6. **Time Lag**: Some reported 2023 transactions may reflect pre-2022 contracts or measurement artifacts

---

## Conclusion

The India-Iran case demonstrates that **well-designed sanctions can achieve volume reduction objectives** when:

1. **Secondary sanctions** impose high compliance costs on third parties
2. **Target relationships** are not strategically essential to third-party economies
3. **Alternative suppliers** exist at competitive prices
4. **Enforcement** is comprehensive across financial and logistics networks

**Key Finding**: Unlike the Russia case (where sanctions produced pricing effects only), Iran sanctions achieved **complete oil trade cessation**, imposing costs entirely on Iran rather than creating shared burdens.

**Policy Implication**: Sanctions effectiveness depends less on the sanctioned country's economic size than on the **sanctions architecture design** and **third-party compliance incentives**.

**Analytical Limit**: This analysis cannot determine:
- Extent of unofficial trade via third countries
- Long-run feasibility of Iran's economic isolation
- Whether India's compliance reflects permanent alignment or temporary calculation

The data support a **strategic compliance story** where India chose US alignment over Iranian energy access, made feasible by fortuitous timing (Russian oil became available at discounts shortly after Iranian supply loss).
